Strings i Dart;
you can define a string different ways including 

using '' or using ""

But for RAW Strings, you can define it as...
var = r''

BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE SAY ITS A RAW STRING. This means it is
regardless of the text or symbol in te text it will be treated as text
i.e \n thus doesnt skip  a new line its just a \n 

Youu can store multi lines strings LIKE SO"  var s2 = '''
  kwanini usiwaombe,...
  didd you know you can do this
  hugh,..
  ''';"



EVERY THING IN DART IS AN OBJECT...



WHAT IS TEH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ?. AND ?? in dart

?. is an non-error operand
?? is used to assing a default value when there is a null value...
see classes example for explanation....
??= is used to check if teh value is empt if it is tehn we assign a new vallue

ANONYMOUS FUNCTION IS A FUNCTION WITH OUT ANY NAME...

IN DART we define variables with data types var and dynamic.....


THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PARAMETERS....

The are 2 types of parameters, position parameters and named parameters
check in functions to see example 



CONSTANTS IN DART..

we can use CONST and FINAL to define values

when you use final you can only assign once and not more
while when you use const you have to assign the value which is not going to change ever..
